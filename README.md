# Project-Arkyide
Project Arkyide is a suite of tool installing and multi functional scanning using popular tools(like Nmap, yk).
The whole idea of this project is to have all the popular scanning and other simple hacking tools in one place.
## Probably to be added to the project in soon future:
```
- Nmap scanning
- Website scanning using other tools also
- Actively adding more tools to the installing module
- Other miscellaneous stuff
```
### When?
> Welp I guess around 2024 January code will be actively (I hope) updated
